                    <p>We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.
                        We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>

                            <p>Digital Asset Prices and Payment Acceptance. Digital Assets are experimental and risky. The Service attempts to provide fair and accurate price and transaction fee information, but this information is volatile and subject to change without advance notice. For a standard transaction, the price is provided at the time your payment is received and confirmed by the blockchain network, limited to the number of confirmations Currency Hub LLC deems reasonable in order to protect Currency Hub LLC from double spends, 51% attacks or other risks. A payment may be accepted at one block confirmation. At Currency Hub LLC’s discretion, Currency Hub LLC may accept a payment with zero block confirmations.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, a payment broadcasted to the blockchain network does not constitute an acceptance by Currency Hub LLC. Currency Hub LLC only accepts one [form of payment] per Transaction ID (“TXID”). If your funds are deposited in a TXID with more than one Deposit, you will need to contact support to receive a refund. The price will not be honored and your transaction will not be completed. User Transactions that do not confirm within forty-eight (48) hours of being detected may be cancelled. Refund requests will be provided in accordance with our Returns and Refund Policy.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Currency Hub LLC reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Transaction as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order or to enforce any transaction limits. Currency Hub LLC further reserves the right to delay any Transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity. Currency Hub LLC further reserves the right to refuse to process or cancel any Transaction due to technological issues with the blockchain software, Currency Hub LLC software, or for other technological reasons. Currency Hub LLC cannot reverse a Transaction which has been broadcast to a blockchain network.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The Service is available only in connection with those Digital Assets and Transaction limits that Currency Hub LLC, in its sole discretion, decides to support.

                            <br>
                            <p>In the event of a Digital Asset fork, you agree that Currency Hub LLC may temporarily suspend Currency Hub LLC operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that Currency Hub LLC may, in its sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely.</p>
